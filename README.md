## Credits
 The excellent staff at UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Bootcamp provided the beginings of the table of technology used in this README.md. The basic design and layout of the Weather Dashboard is based on a screenshot provided by UC Berkeley Extension. I wrote all the HTML, CSS and JS to implement the site.
 To store data using localStorage, I borrowed heavily from the web storage tutorial at freeCodeCamp.org, modifying as needed.
